// Var names are: case sensitive (fullName != FullName), can't start with number, can't have spaces or hyphens, use camelCase. Can't use reserved keywords (ie. let).

// CONST & VAR - const = constant, var = variable; const = can't be reassigned, var = can be reassigned (old way of creating variables).
//VAR - don't use anymore really - use let and const instead.
/*
const lastName = "Doe";
//lastName = "Smith"; //Can't reassign.
